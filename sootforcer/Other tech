Using octal based integers in strings. You can map these to a single character. Possibly giving cheaper access to ints
Or, we could convert chars into bytes etc

Perhaps we could do a better hashmap using stringbuilders that way. You won't need to initiate a huge array, but can
just generate a 16 bit hash value, convert to char, put in stringbuilder. Then check indexof using the same thing later on
Allows less collisions (we can store more values in 16 bits). Doesn't require initiation and clearing it is cheap.
However, checking whether the value is contained may be more expensive.
